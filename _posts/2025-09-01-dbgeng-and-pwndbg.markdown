This summer, I had the opportunity to participate in Google Summer of Code with the Pwndbg project - a popular GDB plugin used by PWN and RE lovers. Pwndbg provides a powerful context that enhance the debugging experience, containing a ton of useful tools and shortcuts (for example, `vmmap`, the command I use the most, is a significantly improved version of `info proc mappings`).

Although `Pwndbg` is mostly used by `GDB` users, there have been efforts to port this amazing plugin to other debuggers. Last year, `Pwndbg` has been ported to `LLDB` in a successful GSoC project. And this year, it will be ported to `DbgEng`.

So what is `DbgEng`? It's the name of the internal debugger engine that powers the most popular Windows debuggers: `WinDbg`, `cdb`, `ntsd`, ... In Windows/NT world, `WinDbg`/`DbgEng` is widely used for reverse engineer and exploit development for two primary reasons: 1) It's specialized for Windows and 2) Windows Kernel debugging. (I might be wrong, `x64dbg` might be more friendly in some cases, especially in user mode debugging).

The main goal of this GSoC project was to port Pwndbg as a DbgEng extension. This would bring Pwndbg enhancements to the WinDbg console, providing a similar experience to using it with GDB or LLDB; and end users should be able to access all native WinDbg features while also using Pwndbg commands and context windows.

# The challenges

Honestly, from the beginning of the summer and even now as I write this, I have severely underestimated how difficult this project would be. Around April, I spent a week looking at the `DbgEng` and `WinDbg` documentation and estimated that, given the sheer amount of it, the project would go smoothly and be finished by the end of July. However, there were two issues I didn't take into account:

- The documentation was entirely for C/C++, but our plugin runs in Python! While `DbgEng` provides a lot of functionality out-of-the-box, its semantics are vastly different from `GDB` and `LLDB`. Objects in `DbgEng` are managed by COM interfaces using a component-model paradigm, while in GDB/LLDB they follow an object-oriented design. Although the latter part of this write-up shows a surprisingly easy solution, this issue was a major obstacle throughout the project.

- My health. This cost me a majority of the time that I should have spent on the project.

## The Old Way of Context Management

`DbgEng` has seven major interfaces that were heavily involved in the initial implementation of the port:

- `IDebugClient`: Interacts with the client
- `IDebugControl`: Controls the debugging session
- `IDebugSystemObjects`: Manages threads and processes
- `IDebugRegisters`: Manages registers
- `IDebugAdvanced`: Provides access to internal APIs
- `IDebugSymbols`: Manages symbols
- `IDebugDataSpaces`: Manages the address space and virtual memory

Since these don't use an object-oriented approach, context management was a huge problem initially. In the `DbgEng` world, each process consists of a `PID`, `engine PID`, and `HANDLE`. In my initial implementation, processes were distinguished by their `PID`, and each time a process needed to perform an action, `SetCurrentProcessId` had to be used. The initial implementation for this approach can be found in [this commit](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/blob/8778c4fc3001dcbe2a94da6de182b340d0e4e6e5/pwndbg/dbg/dbgeng/__init__.py#L70).

## Type management

The hardest part of working with the Pwndbg API was the symbol and type system. In `DbgEng`, types are managed by `TypeId`s, which can be looked up with `IDebugSymbols::GetTypeId`. However, upon inspecting this function in IDA, I discovered it has a lot of limitations.

*The function uses `SymSearchW`, `SymEnumSymbolsW`, and `SymEnumTypesW` to enumerate symbols in the target's PDB file and then compares the found symbols literally with the search string.*

This means that this function (which is called by `GetTypeId`) can only look up symbols directly from the PDB, not their derived types. During my tests, it managed to find the `TypeId` for `void`, but it couldn't do the same for `void*`. Moreover, it couldn't even find the `TypeId` for basic primitives like `unsigned` or `unsigned long long`.

After reverse engineering DbgEng, I found an obscure [Request](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/request) IOCTL that is exposed to manually control `DbgEng`'s internal data. This IOCTL is documented on Microsoft's site, but itâ€™s very hard to find on Google without searching for the exact term (probably because no one has ever used it before). This approach was implemented in [this commit](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/blob/3452801c228e74c8d2c72a8e033028217cdd536c/pwndbg/dbg/dbgeng/__init__.py#L58).

This IOCTL seemed very promising, but after testing it for a week, I found another huge limitation: the binding of data and type. The `_DEBUG_TYPED_DATA` struct is provided to represent typed data, and for given a TypeId, you can create typed data using `EXT_TDOP_SET_FROM_TYPE_ID_AND_U64`. And... it just didn't work. Upon reverse engineering, I found that this IOCTL requires a valid base address for the underlying data, which makes it impossible to create values on the fly.

*Pseudocode for `dbgeng!TypedData::SetToTypedOffset`. After parsing the given `typeId`, the function attempts to read the data from memory with `TypedData::ReadData`.*

## Interaction between C/C++ and Python

Before GSoC started, I wrote a quick and simple proof-of-concept Python REPL plugin for `WinDbg`. It used `pybind11` to provide a Python runtime for C++. I intended to use `comtypes` and `pybag` to call COM APIs directly in Python. During implementation, I ran into a big problem with the DbgEng API: some functions (e.g., `IDebugClient::Output`) use variadic arguments, which are obviously not supported by `comtypes` (or COM itself!).

`ctypes` gives you the ability to dynamically change `argtypes`, but during testing, I ran into a [nasty bug](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/138008) that took me a whole morning to figure out. In the end, I found an internal workaround after reading every line of code in `comtypes`, which is implemented in [this commit](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/pull/3159/commits/a870adbbd92ae8101aefb3f6eecb4563c286d5ae#diff-b1eb57c6567a57aafc7000738a50e437bda71982896957c09760a9c866bbb085).

## Event callbacks and Python GIL
`DbgEng` uses an event callback system that requires you to implement a COM class (`IDebugEventCallback`) and register it with `IDebugClient::SetEventCallbacks`. The registered callbacks are then called in a separate thread from the main Python thread. In Python, only one thread is allowed to execute Python code at a time due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

`ctypes` is designed with this in mind. [The docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html#ctypes.CFUNCTYPE) state that

> The function will release the GIL during the call

which made it seem like a non-issue. However, during testing, the plugin crashed a lot! At that time, I switched from my in-house PoC plugin to [pykd-ext](https://github.com/ivellioscolin/pykd-ext/tree/e78e6c8f691be922ea1ac9e98998ebcc4488c93d), another great Python REPL implementation, and I had to edit many parts of its codebase to handle the GIL issue. The `ctypes` library itself also has some GIL issues; I have debugged and found the root cause but haven't had time to file the issue yet (stay tuned). The workarounds and the implementation of the event system can be found in [this commit](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/blob/50657628dc6792b5c988c0e9f45ab18eec8f76ec/pwndbg/dbg/dbgeng/events.py#L35).

# Latest design
## The new way to manage contexts

I started function tracing in DbgEng to understand how the `dx` command works. And it turns out the calls aren't handled in `DbgEng` itself, but in another library named `DbgModel`.

`DbgModel` provides an extensive, scriptable C++ data model. I actually found this library back in April but thought it was just for high-level scripting and that low-level access from the `IDebug*` interfaces would be better. When I recently looked into this library again, I found the solution to many of the issues I was facing.

```js
0:000> dx Debugger.Sessions[0].Processes[0x581c].Threads[0x5b60].Stack.Frames[0]
Debugger.Sessions[0].Processes[0x581c].Threads[0x5b60].Stack.Frames[0] : ntdll!LdrpDoDebuggerBreak + 0x37
    LocalVariables   : Unexpected failure to dereference object
    Parameters       : Unexpected failure to dereference object
    Attributes
```

In the current design, contexts are managed by an object-oriented interface named `IDebugHostContext`. This interface provides a universal standpoint for all tools (evaluations, symbol lookups). The processes, threads, and stack frames are represented by a generic `IDebugModel`. For instance, the process internal attributes are represented as follows:

```js
0:000> dx @$curprocess
@$curprocess     : test.exe
    Name             : test.exe
    Id               : 0x581c
    Handle           : 0x1f0
    Threads
    Modules
    Environment
    Devices
    Io
 ```
 
## An effective way to manage types
Types are managed using the `IDebugHostType` interface. `DbgModel` [categorizes objects into multiple groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/data-model-cpp-objects), and the following groups are used in the implementation:
- Intrinsic values
- Native objects

Currently, casting objects from type to type only works with intrinsic values.

## The COM wrappers
I implemented the wrappers for all COM interfaces used in the core implementation. This wrapper could be removed entirely after we can nicely parse the C headers `DbgEng.h` and `DbgModel.h` to C that preserve the `_In_` and `_Out_` attributes. `comtypes` is able to handle those quite nicely. `pydbgeng` provides [a nice Perl script](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pydbgeng/) as a starting point.

## The C/C++ Plugin
As of this writing, the plugin part hasnâ€™t been implemented yet. The commands are dispatched manually using `pykd`â€™s REPL.

I intend to have a simple plugin that allows users to just type `!vmmap` or `!context` to show the virtual memory and context, respectively. However, `DbgEng` does not allow dynamic command registration; all commands must be DLL-exported C callbacks. So the current idea is to use macros, combined with [a dispatching system](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/blob/8778c4fc3001dcbe2a94da6de182b340d0e4e6e5/pwndbg/dbg/dbgeng/dispatch.py) implemented in Python, to effectively handle user commands.

# Remarks
Even with the new debugger data model approach, a major problem is still there: there are literally no examples for its API. This meant every function had to be tested using a trial-and-error approach, and if something didnâ€™t work, reverse engineering and debugging was the only way to know why.

At its current state, most of the core functionality is implemented. The current list of missing features is:

- Stack frames
- Proper type casting
- An improved event handling system
- The C++ plugin (and its build system)
- A proper build system to generate the TLB from MIDL files
- Unit tests
